# image-processing-app

Java application for processing a single image with filters or filtering across two images. Also includes the ability to select a Region of Interest (ROI) and apply multiple filters onto a single image.

Single image filters:  

- Negative  
- Rescale  
- Shift  
- Shift and rescale + random noise  
- Bitwise NOT  
- Logarithmic Function filter  
- Power Law Function filter  
- Random Lookup Table filter  
- Bit plane Slicing  
- Histogram Equalisation  
- Image Convolution (includes the following masks: averaging, weighted averaging, 4 and 8 neighbour laplacian, 4 and 8 neighbour Laplacian enhancement, Roberts, Sobel X and Sobel Y).  
- Salt and Pepper noise  
- Order statistics filtering (incl. min filter, max filter, midpoint filter, median filter)
- Thresholding (incl. simple thresholding and iterative thresholding)

Double image filters:

- Addition
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication
- Division  
- Bitwise AND  
- Bitwise OR  
- Bitwise XOR
